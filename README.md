Welcome to the Programmers Tech repository! This repository is dedicated to housing a collection of Python internship tasks and projects developed during my journey as a Python enthusiast. Each task and project is crafted to showcase practical applications of Python programming concepts, algorithms, and best practices.

# Calculator
This is a simple yet functional calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, percentages, exponentiation, and allows clearing and deleting entries. It is designed with a modern look, featuring a black and white color scheme for both the buttons and the display.

# Features

Percentage Calculation:  Convert a number to its percentage form.
Exponentiation: Calculate the exponent of a number.
Clear and Delete Functions: Easily clear the entire input or delete the last entered digit.
Responsive GUI: A user-friendly interface that updates the display with each button press.

# Getting Started
Run the calculator.py script to launch the calculator application.

# Dependencies

Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

# Usage
To use the calculator, simply click the buttons corresponding to the digits and operations you want to perform. The results will be displayed in the entry widget at the top. You can clear the input with the 'C' button, delete the last digit with the '<' button, and calculate the result with the '=' button.
